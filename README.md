# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Classification Project

An analysis of cardiovascular risk prediction using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Various machine learning algorithms are applied and evaluated for their performance in predicting cardiovascular risk.

## Key Findings

- **Age and Gender**: Age and gender are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, with men being more likely to develop CHD than women.
- **Smoking**: Smoking is a risk factor for CHD, and smoking intensity plays a role in determining the risk.
- **Clinical Variables**: High blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes are associated with a higher risk of CHD.
- **Laboratory Variables**: Patients with high cholesterol levels may be at a slightly higher risk for CHD.
- **Model Performance**: Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost models performed the best, with high accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
- **Accuracy Rate**: The Random Forest Classifier model achieved an accuracy rate of 90.36% in predicting cardiovascular risk.

## Tools and Skills

- **Python**: Used for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Utilized for data visualization to create insightful plots and graphs.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implemented various machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

## Takeaways

- **Improved Risk Assessment**: Machine learning models can provide more accurate predictions of cardiovascular risk compared to traditional risk assessment methods.
- **Early Intervention**: Early identification of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease allows for timely intervention and preventive measures.
- **Personalized Medicine**: Machine learning models can help tailor interventions and treatments based on individual risk profiles.
- **Healthcare Resource Allocation**: Predictive models can assist healthcare providers in allocating resources more efficiently by targeting high-risk individuals.
